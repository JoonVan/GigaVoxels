First simplified version but the principe is:


Windows:
[ 1 ]
- Go in Install directory and use the script "unzip all" if present, or unzip all external dependencies in the "External" directory. You should obtain a x64 or x86 directory storing all dependencies.

[ 2 ]
- Install ImageMagick Tools: it is located in the Tools.7z compressed file in the "External" directory.


[ 3 ]
- Go in Install directory and edit the script "makeLibrary.bat" to choose which version of Visual Studio you want to use, then execute the script.
- The "makeLibrary.bat" generate a "Generated_VC10" directory where you can find the generated Visual Solution (in fact the subfolder Library directory)
- Open "the Library.sln" and compile.
- All GigaVoxels header files (*h., *.inl, *.hcu), library files (GigaVoxels.dll and/or GigaVoxels.lib) are copied in the root "Release" directory (Bin, Inc, Lib).
- This "Release" directory is used as a SDK repository that all Tutorials and Tools use to compile.

[ 4 ]
- Now, as for the library, go in Install directory and launch "makeDemoTutorials.bat"
- Like before, go in the Generated_VC10 directory and compile the Tutorials solution.

[ 5 ]
- Now, as for the library and tutorials, go in Install directory and launch "makeTools.bat"
- Like before, go in the Generated_VC10 directory and compile the Tools solution.

- Now, as for the library, go in Install directory and launch "makeViewerPluginTutorials.bat"
- Like before, go in the Generated_VC10 directory and compile the Tutorials solution.


[ 6 ]
- Go in Install directory and use the script "updateRelease.bat" to copy all libraries needed at run-time in the Release directory where all Tutorials and Tools have been copied.

[ 7 ]
- Go in Data directory and unzip the few voxels 3D models in the Data\Voxels directory (do "extract here" with 7-zip)
- Go in Data directory and unzip the few 3D Models in the Data\3DModels directory (do "extract here" with 7-zip)

- Go in Install directory and use the script "updateData.bat" to copy all data needed at run-time in the Release directory where all Tutorials and Tools have been copied.
- Go in Install directory and use the script "updateShaders.bat" to copy all data needed at run-time in the Release directory where all Tutorials and Tools have been copied.


[ 8 ]
- Go in "Release/Bin" to launch your demos.
- NOTE: For the moment, the viewer.exe and voxelizer.exe tools are located in the Release\Tools subdirectory. Copy them in the Release\Bin directory to execute them.

LINUX:
[ 1 ]
- Go in Install directory and use the script "unzip all" if present, or unzip all external dependencies in the "External" directory. You should obtain a x64 or x86 directory storing all dependencies.
// TODO => 7z n'est pas un bon format pour zipper les fichiers (pas assez générique), changer ça en .zip ?

[ 2 ]
- Go in Install directory and then execute the script "makeLibrary.sh"
- The "makeLibrary.sh" generate a "Generated_Linux" directory where you can find the generated Makefiles (in fact the subfolder Library directory)
- Go to Library directory and compile. You can type "make help" to see what you can compile. Just type "make", or "make SimpleSphereDemo", or "make -jN" if you want to use several processors (N is the number)
- All GigaVoxels header files (*h., *.inl), library files (GigaVoxels.so or GigaSpace.so) are copied in the root "Release" directory (Bin, Inc, Lib).
- This "Release" directory is used as a SDK repository that all Tutorials and Tools use to compile.
NOTE: a command line like "make 2>&1 | grep -E "[eE]rror|$" can help you to see only errors. Or "make SimpleSphereDemo 2>&1 | grep -E "[eE]rror|$"
